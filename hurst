I have had a hard time finding an intuitive definition for the term long memory process, so I'll give my definition: 
a long memory process is a process with a random component, 
where a past event has a decaying effect on future events. 
The process has some memory of past events, which is "forgotten" as time moves forward. 
For example, large trades in a market will move the market price 
(e.g., a large purchase order will tend to move the price up, a large sell order will tend to move the price downward). 
This effect is referred to as market impact (see The Market Impact Model by Nicolo Torre, BARRA Newsletter, Winter 1998). 
When an order has measurable market impact, the market price does not immediately rebound to the previous price after the order is filled. 
The market acts as if it has some "memory" of what took place and the effect of the order decays over time. 
Similar processes allow momentum trading to have some value.


Hurst spent a lifetime studying the Nile and the problems related to water storage. 
He invented a new statistical method -- the rescaled range analysis (R/S analysis) -- 
which he described in detail in an interesting book, Long-Term Storage: An Experimental Study (Hurst et al., 1965).
Fractals by Jens Feder, Plenum, 1988

This method for estimating the Hurst exponent was developed and analyzed by Benoit Mandelbrot and his co-authors 
in papers published between 1968 and 1979.


One of the problems Hurst studied was the size of reservoir construction. 
If a perfect reservoir is constructed, it will store enough water during the dry season so that it never runs out. 
The amount of water that flows into and out of the reservoir is a random process. 
In the case of inflow, the random process is driven by rainfall. In the case of outflow, the process is driven by demand for water.
