I have had a hard time finding an intuitive definition for the term long memory process, so I'll give my definition: 
a long memory process is a process with a random component, 
where a past event has a decaying effect on future events. 
The process has some memory of past events, which is "forgotten" as time moves forward. 
For example, large trades in a market will move the market price 
(e.g., a large purchase order will tend to move the price up, a large sell order will tend to move the price downward). 
This effect is referred to as market impact (see The Market Impact Model by Nicolo Torre, BARRA Newsletter, Winter 1998). 
When an order has measurable market impact, the market price does not immediately rebound to the previous price after the order is filled. 
The market acts as if it has some "memory" of what took place and the effect of the order decays over time. 
Similar processes allow momentum trading to have some value.
